Building

Create directories

	Headers
	Libraries
	
along side Projects, Resources and Sources (if they do not exist).


Mac OS X

The plug-in was built using Xcode 3.2.3 on Mac OS X 10.6.4.

Download the Mac version of the FileMaker External Plug-In API from

	http://www.filemaker.com/support/technologies/
	
and place the FMWrapper.framework in the Libraries directory.

On the Mac most of the required headers and library files are installed by default on the system. The only third-party libraries that need to be built are the Boost FileSystem and System libraries. Boost is available from

	http://www.boost.org/
	
The plug-in is a universal binary and the boost libraries should be built accordingly. For example:

	cd boost_1_43_0
	./bootstrap.sh
	./bjam architecture=combined
	
The boost headers must be placed in the Headers directory and the libboost_filesystem.a and libboost_system.a libraries placed in the Libraries directory.


Windows

The plug-in was built using Visual Studio 2010 Professional on Windows 7.

Download the Windows version of the FileMaker External Plug-In API from

	http://www.filemaker.com/support/technologies/
	
rename the Headers directory FMWrapper and place it in the Headers directory. FMWrapper.lib should be placed the Libraries directory.

The BaseElements plug-in is built as a static library and all third-party libraries must be built from source as static libraries (/MTd & /MT) using libcmt.lib and nafxcw.lib for release and libcrtd.lib and nafxcwd.lib for debug builds. 


Boost

the Boost FileSystem and System libraries are required.

	http://www.boost.org/
	
The boost headers must be placed in the Headers directory and the libboost_filesystem-vc100-mt-s-1_43.lib and libboost_system-vc100-mt-s-1_43.lib libraries placed in the Libraries directory (libboost_filesystem-vc100-mt-sgd-1_43.lib and libboost_system-vc100-mt-sgd-1_43.lib for debug builds).


libiconv & libcharset

	http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/
	
place libiconv.lib and libcharset.lib in the libraries directory and iconv.h in a directory iconv inside the Headers directory.


zlib

	http://www.zlib.net/

place zlib.h in the Headers directory and zlib.lib in the Libraries directory.


libxml2

	http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html

place the headers in a directory, libxml, in the Headers directory and libxml2_a.lib in the Libraries directory.


libxslt & libexslt

	http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/downloads.html
	
place the headers for each of libxsl and libexslt in directories named libxsl and libexslt inside the Headers directory and libxslt_a.lib and libexslt_a.lib in the Libraries directory.
