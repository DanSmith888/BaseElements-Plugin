#
# Configuration file for iOSAppSDK 18.0.3
#

#
# Note that this file is encoded using the UTF-8 character encoding. Do not change this character encoding, or your
# application may not build correctly.
#

# Launch Solution (required)
# This is the file to open when your app is launched.
# It should be in the Solution Files folder along with the rest of the files for your solution.
launchSolution = BaseElements Plugin Tests.fmp12

# Help URL (optional)
# Specify a URL where help can be found.
# If not specified, the help menu item will be removed from the generated app.
# Example:  helpURL = https://com.myCompany.myApp/help
helpURL =

# Solution Files Copy Option (required)
# The value of this flag controls under what circumstances the solution files are copied into the Documents directory
# on the device. The value can be either the number or the string.
#   1 - always              The solution files are always copied every time the application is run.
#   2 - once                The solution files are copied the first time the application is run, and are never copied again.
#   3 - versionChange       The solution files are copied the first time the application is run, or if the application's
#                           externally visible version number changes. (See the discussion of CFBundleShortVersionString
#                           in Xcode's help.)
#   4 - buildVersionChange  The solution files are copied the first time the application is run, or if the application's
#                           build number changes.
#
# The following two examples have the same effect.
# Example: solutionCopyOption = versionChange
# Example: solutionCopyOption = 3
solutionCopyOption = always

# Encryption Password Obfuscation (optional) To protect your solution files from unauthorized access, you can use
# FileMaker Pro Advanced to encrypt the files, then include the encryption passwords in configFile.txt. The passwords will
# be embedded in the app, but they will be obfuscated to make it difficult to reconstruct them.  Note: Obfuscation doesn't
# provide complete security, but it hides sensitive data.
#
# Example 1: A simple password used for all solutions:
#    dbePassword default = "Hello World"
# The password in this example is:
#    Hello World
#
# Example 2: A password with embedded quotation marks:
#    dbePassword default = "Hello \"World\""
# The password in this example is:
#    Hello "World"
#
# Example 3: A password with embedded backslash characters
#    dbePassword default = "\\Hello\\ World"
# The password in this example is:
#    \Hello\ World
#
# Example 4: One password for a specific file and another password for all other files:
#    dbePassword "A Specific File.fmp12" = "Specific File Password"
#    dbePassword default = "All Files Password"

# App Delegate Class (optional)
# Specify the name of the class that defines your app delegate. When the app launches, 
# an instance of the class is created to receive the UIApplicationDelegate messages.
# Your delegate needs to implement only the messages it wants to receive.
# Example: applicationDelegateClass = myAppDelegate
# applicationDelegateClass =
