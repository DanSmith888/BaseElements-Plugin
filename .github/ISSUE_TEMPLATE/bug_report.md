**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
We need to know :
1. Which functions you called.
2. What were the parameter values you used.
3. What the output was.
4. Other potential debug information.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS and version : [e.g. macOS 11.1]
 - FileMaker Version [e.g. FileMaker Pro 19.4 or FileMaker Server 20.1]
 - Plugin Version from BE_VersionAutoUpdate [e.g. 04020601]

**Additional context**
 - If you're using any of the curl functions ( HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc ) include the output of the BE_CurlTrace function, after the function call.
 - Or the output of the BE_DebugInformation for newer plugin versions - if it includes the Trace then a separate trace isn't required.

If the trace/debug is large, you may need to save that to a text file and attach separately.
