IMAP - read folders, read messages, move messages, delete messages.
Filter on the File lists to only allow selecting various file formats.
Documenting the error codes to give a bit more info about which library is throwing the error.
BarCode Scanning - http://zbar.sourceforge.net/ or https://github.com/zxing
Printer selection.
Extend the install script step stuff, to do binary data, Add a Clear all function, Add a check to see if a function is installed or not.
Duktape module support for loading external modules in the JS function.
Some conversion of functions to script steps where appropriate
Changing the MIME library we use to allow multipart/related attachments and therefore inline images in HTML email.  Or options to allow the inserting of images that can then be referenced in manually generated HTML later.
